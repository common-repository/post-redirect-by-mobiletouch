How to optimize your URLs?
1# URLs must be readable by everyone
Both readers and search engines must be capable of reading your URL. Search engines as readers, read your URLs words to know what the page is going to be about. That’s why you should not use dynamically generated URLs and customize them in order to provide full comprehension of your content and target.
Example: if you are an ecommerce shop selling black leather jacket you should write the dedicated page URL this way:



2# Organize your content
The way an URL is written bring information on its importance. In fact, search engines regard web pages in root folder as a top content that should be prioritized over other ones. That’s why you need to categorize your URLs in order to clearly determine and show to search engines which URL should get a little boost in the SERPs.
Example: will get more authority than and more than 

3# Do not use capital
Capital letter can confuse search engines and readers as it can make it more difficult to understand.

4# Prefer hyphens to underscores
If you want to optimize your URL then the way you separate words does matter. Actually, Google robots are set up to read hyphens and not underscores. If you want to have a chance to get ranked, then you have to apply this rule.


5# Add your mobile URLs to a sitemap <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/">mobile app</a> 
This is a good way to inform search engines which web pages are mobile friendly and which one are not. Those first ones seems to rank higher in the SERPs since the Google mobile update. Even if some experts say that responsive URLs do not not need to be included to a sitemap, it is safer to do so.

6# Include your target keyword
Try your best to include your primary keyword in your URLs. Even if in most cases it can’t be done on your homepage, focus on integrating your target keyword related to your product or category pages.

7# Block unsafe URLs with robots.txt
Bad URLs can get you penalized by search engines if they index duplicate URLs for example or other unoptimized URLs. For instance, you can have features creating filters on your website generating dynamic and duplicated URLs. You can thus block those extra URLs using robots.txt.

8# Canonicalize your URLs <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zen-mobile-app-native/">wptouch</a>
Some pages can sometimes create duplicate content when they are dynamic pages with filters for instance. The way to prevent this action, is to use canonical URLs. This tag can be used if you want a specific URL to become the preferred one even if other ones direct to the same content. In this case, you need to add a rel=”canonical” link element in the head of any pages with the same content.
Example: 
Also, you should set up your URL preferred domain. Actually, search engines perceives www, https, non www, etc as different websites and then will categorize this content as duplicate.
Another way to avoid duplicates is to set up your dynamic parameters and tell search engines when they should ignore those parameters. It can be the case with pagination or session ID.

9# Don’t forget 301 redirect for broken URLs
If you need to change a page URL for any reason, do not forget to inform search engines its new location. Actually, there are chances that search engines have indexed that page. You don’t want to lose link juice from a well ranked page so that’s why you need to implement 301 redirect on the old URL place to notify Google bots your new URL destination.

10# Add a favicon
Even if they do not have a direct SEO impact on your rankings,<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/webapp-builder/">mobile app</a>  favicons have a lot of advantages. This little icon next to your URL in browser helps better recognize your website brand. It is also easier to your website in bookmarks. It thus will help to develop your brand visibility

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Add a custom field <code>redirect</code> with an url value to a post. Easy.
4. View the post.

URL structure
When it comes to the URLs themselves, think short, simple, accurate, and not redundant.

1. Use keywords and post names instead of generic post numbers
If you use a blogging tool as your content management tool, good for you! It's one of the easiest ways to keep your content organized. It also often names your pages something totally blah like which tells the search engine nothing about the page. It's usually pretty easy to swap out the auto-populated link for something more explanatory. For instance in WordPress, it's under Settings > Permalinks. I recommend choosing the shortest option, such as And don't forget that you can edit the permalink to something else in the post, too!

Note: Changing the permalinks after the fact can mess up inbound links from other sites and internal links, so be careful doing it.

2. When naming pages, use hyphens instead of underscores
Search engines often read words with underscores as one word. So "wedding_photography" might be read as "weddingphotography," which is not as searched as much as "wedding photography." It will see a hyphen as a space.

3. Keywords and keyword research
Focus your page name on the most accurate, but also keyword-friendly phrases that pertain to your content. If your page is a blog post about a Bay Area beach wedding, you'll be better off naming it /bay-area-beach-wedding than say, /sam-and-pats-wedding. It's far more likely that someone will be using the search term "beach wedding" than "sam and pat." As you get more comfortable with naming pages, it's worth it to spend a little time researching more popular search terms. But don't go crazy trying to match keywords. Just be as accurate as you can to the content on the page.

4. Shorten those URLs
In addition to just being more convenient to type and remember, shorter URLs are less likely to be seen by search engines as keyword stuffing. Pages and URLs with lots of keywords can get penalized and drop in search rankings. Four to seven words is a good guideline to follow.

More advanced tips
(Don't pass GO unless you're pretty comfortable with it!)

5. Use subfolders instead of subdomains
Unless you have a specific reason, it's usually better to set up content within a subfolder  Search engines treat subdomains as different entities, and don't pass on rank and authority to it in the same way as a subfolder, which is treated more as part of the top-level site.

6. Static URLs are better than Dynamic URLs
You've seen dynamic URLs before. They often contain question marks, equal signs, and can usually be found in search pages and big database sites. Search engines just don't like these as much as a page with a static URL. If your site is smaller, you probably don't have to worry as much about this. If your site is larger and utilizes these, you can still use all those sorting and tracking features of dynamic URLs while maintaining the static type of URL by using cookies. Your webmaster can help with this.

If your site still needs dynamic URLs, Google's Webmaster Tools can actually filter them out using the "adjust parameter" option in the settings.

7. www vs. no www
If your site is accessible from both you might have this problem. Search engines could see your site as having duplicate content. You can fix it by having a server-based 301 redirect to redirect one of the URLs into your preferred format. You'll also want to set this preferred URL as "canonical" with Google. This means that you'll tell Google to which URL you want the juice flowing. Here's how.
<a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/">mobile app</a> 
Many of these rules are fluid and change very frequently (on purpose, to keep us honest!), so take everything with a grain of salt. And don't sweat it. If you've made the Google gods mad in the past, there are always ways of getting back in their good graces… like candy.
== Other Notes ==

It's been a long time since we covered one of the most fundamental building blocks of SEO—the structure of domain names and URLs—and I think it's high time to revisit. But, an important caveat before we begin: the optimal structures and practices I'll be describing in the tips below are NOT absolutely critical on any/every page you create. This list should serve as an "it would be great if we could," not an "if we don't do things this way, the search engines will never rank us well." Google and Bing have come a long way and can handle a lot of technical challenges, but as always in SEO, the easier we make things for them (and for users), the better the results tend to be.

It's hard to argue this given the preponderance of evidence and examples of folks moving their content from a subdomain to subfolder and seeing improved results (or, worse, moving content to a subdomain and losing traffic). Whatever heuristics the engines use to judge whether content should inherit the ranking ability of its parent domain seem to have trouble consistently passing to subdomains.

That's not to say it can't work, and if a subdomain is the only way you can set up a blog or produce the content you need, then it's better than nothing. But your blog is far more likely to perform well in the rankings and to help the rest of your site's content perform well if it's all together on one sub and root domain.
t should come as no surprise that the easier a URL is to read for humans, the better it is for search engines. Accessibility has always been a part of SEO, but never more so than today, when engines can leverage advanced user and usage data signals to determine what people are engaging with vs. not.

Readability can be a subjective topic, but hopefully this illustration can help:

scale of url readability
The requirement isn't that every aspect of the URL must be absolutely clean and perfect, but that at least it can be easily understood and, hopefully, compelling to those seeking its content.
It's still the case that using the keywords you're targeting for rankings in your URLs is a solid idea. This is true for several reasons.

First, keywords in the URL help indicate to those who see your URL on social media, in an email, or as they hover on a link to click that they're getting what they want and expect, as shown in the Metafilter example below (note how hovering on the link shows the URL in the bottom-left-hand corner):

keywords in urls
Second, URLs get copied and pasted regularly, and when there's no anchor text used in a link, the URL itself serves as that anchor text (which is still a powerful input for rankings), e.g.:

url as anchor text
Third, and finally, keywords in the URL show up in search results, and research has shown that the URL is one of the most prominent elements searchers consider when selecting which site to click.

urls in serps
If you can avoid using URL parameters, do so. If you have more than two URL parameters, it's probably worth making a serious investment to rewrite them as static, readable, text.

Most CMS platforms have become savvy to this over the years, but a few laggards remain. Check out tools like mod_rewrite and ISAPI rewrite or MS' URL Rewrite Module (for IIS) to help with this process.

Some dynamic parameters are used for tracking clicks (like those inserted by popular social sharing apps such as Buffer). In general, these don't cause a huge problem, but they may make for somewhat unsightly and awkwardly long URLs. Use your own judgement around whether the tracking parameter benefits outweigh the negatives.

vanity domain urls click volume
Research from a 2014 RadiumOne study suggests that social sharing (which has positive, but usually indirect impacts on SEO) with shorter URLs that clearly communicate the site and content perform better than non-branded shorteners or long, unclear URL strings.
Shorter URLs are, generally speaking, preferable. You don't need to take this to the extreme, and if your URL is already less than 50-60 characters, don't worry about it at all. But if you have URLs pushing 100+ characters, there's probably an opportunity to rewrite them and gain value.

This isn't a direct problem with Google or Bing—the search engines can process long URLs without much trouble. The issue, instead, lies with usability and user experience. Shorter URLs are easier to parse, to copy and paste, to share on social media, and to embed, and while these might all add up to only a fractional improvement in sharing or amplification, every tweet, like, share, pin, email, and link matters (either directly or, often, indirectly).

#7: Match URLs to titles most of the time (when it makes sense)

This doesn't mean that if the title of your piece is "My Favorite 7 Bottles of Islay Whisky (and how one of them cost me my entire Lego collection)" that your URL has to be a perfect match. Something like

randswhisky.com/my-favorite-7-islay-whiskies

would be just fine. So, too would

randswhisky.com/blog/favorite-7-bottles-islay-whisky

or variations on these. The matching accomplishes a mostly human-centric goal, i.e. to imbue an excellent sense of what the web user will find on the page through the URL and then to deliver on that expectation with the headline/title.

It's for this same reason that we strongly recommend keeping the page title (which engines display prominently on their search results pages) and the visible headline on the page a close match as well—one creates an expectation, and the other delivers on it.

clear vs unclear url on facebook
For example, above, you'll see two URLs I shared on Facebook. In the first, it's wholly unclear what you might find on the page. It's in the news section the BBC's website, but beyond that, there's no way to know what you might find there. In the second, however, Pacific Standard magazine has made it easy for the URL to give insight into the article's content, and then the title of the piece delivers:


We should aim for a similar level of clarity in our own URLs and titles.

#8: Including stop words isn't necessary

If your title/headline includes stop words (and, or, but, of, the, a, etc.), it's not critical to put them in the URL. You don't have to leave them out, either, but it can sometimes help to make a URL shorter and more readable in some sharing contexts. Use your best judgement on whether to include or not based on the readability vs. length.

You can see in the URL of this particular post you're now reading, for example, that I've chosen to leave in "for" because I think it's easier to read with the stop word than without, and it doesn't extend the URL length too far.

#9: Remove/control for unwieldy punctuation characters

There are a number of text characters that become nasty bits of hard-to-read cruft when inserted in the URL string. In general, it's a best practice to remove or control for these. There's a great list of safe vs. unsafe characters available on Perishable Press:

safe vs unsafe characters in urls
It's not merely the poor readability these characters might cause, but also the potential for breaking certain browsers, crawlers, or proper parsing.

#10: Limit redirection hops to two or fewer <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/mobile-app-builder-by-wappress/">mobile app</a>  

If a user or crawler requests URL A, which redirects to URL B. That's cool. It's even OK if URL B then redirects to URL C (not great—it would be more ideal to point URL A directly to URL C, but not terrible). However, if the URL redirect string continues past two hops, you could get into trouble.

Generally speaking, search engines will follow these longer redirect jumps, but they've recommended against the practice in the past, and for less "important" URLs (in their eyes), they may not follow or count the ranking signals of the redirecting URLs as completely.

The bigger trouble is browsers and users, who are both slowed down and sometimes even stymied (mobile browsers in particular can occasionally struggle with this) by longer redirect strings. Keep redirects to a minimum and you'll set yourself up for less problems.

#11: Fewer folders is generally better

Take a URL like this:

randswhisky.com/scotch/lagavulin/15yr/distillers-edition/pedro-ximenez-cask/750ml

And consider, instead, structuring it like this:

randswhisky.com/scotch/lagavulin-distillers-edition-750ml

It's not that the slashes (aka folders) will necessarily harm performance, but it can create a perception of site depth for both engines and users, as well as making edits to the URL string considerably more complex (at least, in most CMS' protocols).

There's no hard and fast requirement—this is another one where it's important to use your best judgement.

#12: Avoid hashes in URLs that create separate/unique content

The hash (or URL fragment identifier) has historically been a way to send a visitor to a specific location on a given page (e.g. Moz's blog posts use the hash to navigate you to a particular comment, like this one from my wife). Hashes can also be used like tracking parameters (e.g. randswhisky.com/lagavulin#src=twitter). Using URL hashes for something other than these, such as showing unique content than what's available on the page without the hash or wholly separate pages is generally a bad idea.

There are exceptions, like those Google enables for developers seeking to use the hashbang format for dynamic AJAX applications, but even these aren't nearly as clean, visitor-friendly, or simple from an SEO perspective as statically rewritten URLs. Sites from Amazon to Twitter have found tremendous benefit in simplifying their previously complex and hash/hashbang-employing URLs. If you can avoid it, do.

#13: Be wary of case sensitivity <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2android-turn-wp-site-into-android-app/">mobile plugin</a>

A couple years back, John Sherrod of Search Discovery wrote an excellent piece noting the challenges and issues around case-sensitivity in URLs. Long story short—if you're using Microsoft/IIS servers, you're generally in the clear. If you're hosting with Linux/UNIX, you can get into trouble as they can interpret separate cases, and thus randswhisky.com/AbC could be a different piece of content from randswhisky.com/aBc. That's bad biscuits.

microsoft vs unix case sensitive urls
In an ideal world, you want URLs that use the wrong case to automatically redirect/canonicalize to the right one. There are htaccess rewrite protocols to assist ( like this one)—highly recommended if you're facing this problem.

#14: Hyphens and underscores are preferred word separators

Notably missing (for the first time in my many years updating this piece) is my recommendation to avoid underscores as word separators in URLs. In the last few years, the search engines have successfully overcome their previous challenges with this issue and now treat underscores and hyphens similarly.

Spaces can work, but they render awkwardly in URLs as %20, which detracts from the readability of your pages. Try to avoid them if possible (it's usually pretty easy in a modern CMS).

#15: Keyword stuffing and repetition are pointless and make your site look spammy <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/zen-mobile-app-native/">mobile plugin</a>

Check out the search result listing below, and you'll see a whole lot of "canoe puppies" in the URL. That's probably not ideal, and it could drive some searchers to bias against wanting to click.

Some people say there is no such thing as SEO-friendly URL structure. They claim search engines are perfectly capable of making sense of any type of URL and pretty much any URL structure. In most cases, the people who say this are web developers (just so you know, I love Web devs).

I’ve noticed sometimes web developers and SEOs live in two parallel universes, each with its own center of gravity. While web developers basically care about crawlability, site speed, and other technical things, SEOs are mostly focused on what constitutes their sacred grail: website rankings and ROI.

Hence, what may be an OK site URL structure to a web dev, could be a totally SEO-unfriendly URL architecture to an SEO manager:

What is an SEO-friendly URL structure?
First of all, let me start by saying that it is always better to call in an SEO manager early in the development stage, so there is no need to make sometimes hard-to-implement tweaks afterwards.

From an SEO point of view, a site’s URL structure should be:

Straightforward: URLs with duplicate content should have canonical URLs specified for them; there should be no confusing redirects on the site, etc.
Meaningful: URL names should have keywords in them, not gibbering numbers and punctuation marks.
With emphasis on the right URLs: SEO-wise, not all URLs on a site are of equal importance as a rule. Some even should be concealed from the search engines. At the same time, it is important to check that the pages that ought to be accessible to the search engines are actually open for crawling and indexing.
So, here is what one can do to achieve an SEO-friendly site URL structure:

1. Consolidate your www and the non-www domain versions
As a rule, there are two major versions of your domain indexed in the search engines, the www and the non-www version of it. These can be consolidated in more than one way, but I’d mention the most widely accepted practice.

Most SEOs (in my experience) use the 301 redirect to point one version of their site to the other (or vice versa).

Alternatively (for instance, when you can’t do a redirect), you can specify your preferred version in Google Webmaster Tools in Configuration >> Settings >> Preferred Domain. However,this has certain drawbacks:

This takes care of Google only.
This option is restricted to root domains only. If you have an example.wordpress.com site, this method is not for you.
But why worry about the www vs non-www issue in the first place? Thing is, some of your backlinks may be pointing to your www version, while some could be going to the non-www version.

So, to make sure that both versions’ SEO value is consolidated, it’s better to explicitly establish this link between the two (either via the 301 redirect, or in Google Webmaster Tools, or by using a canonical tag – I’ll talk about that one a bit further).

SEO-friendly URLs have been a topic of debate for many, many years in the SEO and digital marketing industry. There are many factors that come into play here. From the number of folders to the inclusion of the primary keyword, professional SEOs have analyzed numerous combinations to create the perfect URL structure.

In this guide, we are going to discuss and take a good look at how a perfect SEO-friendly and user-friendly URL should be structured.

So, let’s get started with our guide here and see how to structure a good URL for your blog posts.

Tip #1: Keyword Inclusion

Keyword inclusion is a good thing. If you are trying to optimize a blog post for a certain keyword, you should include that main keyword in its URL.

The question is that can it come at the cost of over-optimization? And the simplest answer is that it shouldn’t.

Having your main keyword in the URL of the blog post has numerous benefits, but it shouldn’t look like it is unnaturally stuffed there. Therefore, it is important that you structure your blog post and its URL structure in a way that including the keyword doesn’t seem unnatural or forced.

Moreover, here are a few benefits of including your main keyword in a blog post.

One of the biggest advantages of having your main keyword in a post’s URL is that it turns up in the status bar when someone hovers over the link. Here is an example.

123.gif

Another big advantage is that search-engine users pay a lot of attention to important keywords in the search engine results page. Having the right keywords in the URL structure can increase your search click-through rate (CTR).

Tip #2: Making it More Readable

A good URL is the one that is easily readable by users. Search engines aren’t the only things that need good, clean URLs. You also need to optimize them for human readers as they are the ones who eventually click on your blog post and read it.

Furthermore, as search engines are constantly evolving and getting smarter, they are using strong data and behavioral signals by their users to identify if a ranked page is worthy of its search engine position. In the end, it is the engagement that counts. And a more readable URL structure can significantly increases the engagement rate it gets from search-engine users.

Here is an image created by Moz that explains this concept.

URL readability.gif

The idea is that the URL should be easily readable and identifiable.

If a user already knows what they will get after clicking on a certain like, they are more likely to do it. Such user-friendly and readable URLs also bring more targeted traffic.

On the other hand, the 3rd example in the above image doesn’t give the users any idea what they are going to find on the other side. It may very well be a malware. So, naturally, internet users will be hesitant in clicking such a link.

Tip #3: Making It Short, Sweet, and Simple

Short URL vs. Long URL.

It has always been a matter of debate. Let’s clear this issue once and for all.

Search engines do not particularly have any problem with processing longer URLs. So, in other words, the length of a post’s URL doesn’t directly affect its search engine rankings. However, the problem is about user-experience and usability.

Shorter URLs are usually preferred by users as they are easier to parse, copy, paste, or remember. Moreover, because of the limitations social media websites like Twitter has, shorter URLs are a lot easier to share across the social media networks.

Generally speaking, if the URL of your blog post is under 50 characters, you do not have to worry about it. However, if it is exceeding, say, 100 characters, then you might want to rewrite it and make it more user-friendly.

Note: The URLs of articles ranked on Google’s #1 page contain an average of 37 characters.

Apart from that, there is also an issue of including categories and subcategories in the URL structure. Most of you might know this as including “folders” in the URL of a post.

It looks something like that.



As you can see in the above example, a URL structure becomes too long if you include too many categories.

Now, the question is does it help in the search engines? Unfortunately, it doesn’t really help improving a blog post’s search engine ranking. However, at the same time, such lengthy URLs don’t appear to be very user-friendly.

Popular blogs like BoostBlogTraffic specifically uses shorter URLs with no extra directories.

Here is an example.

Screen Shot 2015-07-15 at 12.47.25 PM.png

So, if you have to choose one option over the other, I’d recommend going with a simple, clean, and short URL structure that is without too many directories and folders.

Tip #4: Match URLs to Titles

The process of search engine optimization isn’t always the most straight-forward. There are various factors that finally determine the search engine ranking of a blog post. By matching the URL of a post with its main title, you can take care of one such factor.

Let me explain.

It is considered a very good practice to match the URL with the title of the post — at least to some extent. This is because when someone opens the link to your blog post after seeing its URL and the keywords in it, he/she expects to read about a certain topic. If the title or content of the page is somewhat different than the keywords present in the URL, it may lead to a “bounce”.

In other words, when search engine users open your blog post, they expect something. It is your job to meet those expectations and deliver the right content.

The URL of a post builds expectations; the title of the post delivers on it. Therefore, both of them should have more or less the same keywords in them.

Tip #5: Don’t Worry About the Stop Words

What if the title or headline of your blog post has stop words in it?

In the previous point, I made it very clear that ideally you should match the title and URL as closely as possible. So what happens to all those stop words?

Fortunately, you don’t have to worry about that.

Stop words like, and, or, but, the, a, etc. are not necessary to be included in the URL. There are no disadvantages of adding these words in the URL, but they can often make a URL unreasonably longer. As you can remember, one of our goals is to always make the URL short, simple, and readable. Avoiding such stop words can help you achieve that goal of simplicity.

Tip #6 Case Sensitivity

Not a lot of bloggers and website owners pay attention to it, but case sensitivity can be a big issue.

If you are using the Microsoft/IIS servers, you don’t have to worry about it at all. However, in case you are hosting with Linux/UNIX, there can be a little bit of problem. This is because hosting with Linux/UNIX means they can interpret separate cases.

For instance, in that case,  may be different from 

Final Words

As you can see, there are no magic rules here. Most of the tips are focused on creating the most user-friendly and readable URL for your web pages. Apart from that, including the primary keyword and then matching it with the title and content of the post are other important factors that you must focus on.

However, in a bid to include keywords, it is important not to over-optimize it as it can lead to a Google penalty.

Search engines have gone through a massive overhaul in the past few years, and now they are smarter than ever. Over-optimization of keywords don’t particularly work anymore — whether it is in the content of the post or if it is in its URL.

Following is a good example of how NOT to do it.

example.gif

As you can see in the image, the keyword “canoe puppies” come multiple times in the URL, title, and the meta-description. It not only becomes a little irritating for the users, search engines also do not prefer such practices anymore.

Focus on creating high-quality content, so Google and other search engines promote it in their SERPs. Then, create an SEO-friendly URL structure by using the tips mentioned above to complement it. That should be the core of your SEO strategy.

Repetition like this doesn't help your search rankings—Google and Bing have moved far beyond algorithms that positively reward a keyword appearing multiple times in the URL string. Don't hurt your chances of earning a click (which CAN impact your rankings) by overdoing keyword matching/repetition in your URLs.
